<b>Research interests:</b> experimental psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, bilingual processing

I am a third-year Ph.D student in the Department of Linguistics at Cornell, focusing on experimental psycholinguistics. My research investigates the representations that people form as they process language. My current projects deal with agreement attraction effects in bilingual processing, and cognitive representations of implicit instruments in event processing; you can read more about them on the "Research" tab!  

I am also a member of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://conf.ling.cornell.edu/compling/">Cornell Computational Linguistics Lab</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://c-psyd.github.io/">Computational Psycholinguistic Discussion group</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lime-lab-cornell.github.io/">Linguistic Meaning Lab</a>, and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopner" href="https://nlp.cornell.edu/">Cornell Natural Language Processing Group</a>.

When I'm not studying linguistics, you can find me reading, rock climbing, racing triathlons, and recently even teaching sea kayaking with Cornell Outdoor Education. I also used to be a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://secure.meetcontrol.com/divemeets/system/profile.php?number=24901">diver</a>.
