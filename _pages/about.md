<b>Research interests:</b> experimental psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, bilingual processing

I am a third-year Ph.D student in the Department of Linguistics at Cornell, focusing on experimental psycholinguistics. My research investigates the online representations that people form as they process language. My current projects deal with agreement attraction effects in bilingual processing, and cognitive representations of implicit instruments in event processing; you can read more about them on the "Research" tab!  

I am also a member of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://conf.ling.cornell.edu/compling/">Cornell Computational Linguistics Lab</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://c-psyd.github.io/">Computational Psycholinguistic Discussion group</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lime-lab-cornell.github.io/">Linguistic Meaning Lab</a>, and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopner" href="https://nlp.cornell.edu/">Cornell Natural Language Processing Group</a>.

Outside of linguistics, you can find me doing one of several "R"s: reading with my cat <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://imgur.com/a/mB1Oy8e">Oakley</a>, rock climbing, running, or racing triathlons. I also used to be a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://secure.meetcontrol.com/divemeets/system/profile.php?number=24901">diver</a>, and now I teach sea kayaking with Cornell Outdoor Education.
