<b>Research interests:</b> psycholinguistics, computational linguistics, syntax/morphosyntax, bilingualism, codeswitching

I am a second-year Ph.D student in the Department of Linguistics at Cornell. My current research for my qualifying paper investigates agreement attraction effects in Spanish-English codeswitching, using both online and offline measures. I am also a member of the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://conf.ling.cornell.edu/compling/">Cornell Computational Linguistics Lab</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://c-psyd.github.io/">Computational Psycholinguistic Discussion group</a>, the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://lime-lab-cornell.github.io/">Linguistic Meaning Lab</a>, and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopner" href="https://nlp.cornell.edu/">Cornell Natural Language Processing Group</a>.

When I'm not studying linguistics, you can find me reading, rock climbing, racing triathlons, and recently even teaching sea kayaking with Cornell Outdoor Education. I also used to be a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://secure.meetcontrol.com/divemeets/system/profile.php?number=24901">diver</a>.
