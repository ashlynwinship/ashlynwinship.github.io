<b><ins>1) The effects of context on implicit category generation </ins></b> 

(with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vansky.github.io/">Marten van Schijndel</a>)

<b>Keywords</b>: categorization, ambiguity, polysemy

Prior experimental work using categorization tasks has explicitly highlighted the categories involved in the task, but in real-world category processing, people are not typically provided with overt category labels. This paper introduces novel tasks designed to test whether people will both generate and access category representations without explicitly knowing that categories are involved in the task. We show that 1) people can extrapolate category representations out of noisy contexts even without being given a category label, and those representations affect their recall of previously-seen items; and 2) the abstract category representations that people form when they do not have explicit category information are malleable, and people will update them when presented with new context.

<b>Keywords</b>: acceptability, typicality, similarity, paradigm, representations

When conducting experimental research, the research questions are often inherently linked (and limited) to the paradigm that is used. In this paper, we present a new experimental tool -- GRIS (Generating Representations in Space) -- that builds experiments where participants can manipulate objects on a screen. Through a series of three experiments on sentence acceptability, category typicality, and multi-dimensional similarity, we demonstrate how GRIS-based experiments allow cognitive scientists to approximate representational spaces for a variety of cognitive phenomena, expanding the set of possible research questions that cognitive scientists may ask.

<b>Keywords</b>: event representation, implicit instruments

Models of events represent the interactions of the entities involved. In the event “The chef chopped an onion,” a chef and an onion are explicitly involved, and the event results in a chopped onion. However, it is also implied that an instrument, e.g., a knife, must interact with the chef and the onion. In this study, we investigate the extent to which people model implicit instruments and other items related to the event. We find that people’s representations of events include instruments that are implied to be involved in the event even when they are not explicitly stated in the event description. These findings are consistent across different sentence constructions of event descriptions, showing that implicit instrument representation is robust in comprehension of events. We also show that implicit instrument representation persists despite lexical priming of other items, and that the representations provide evidence for the disambiguation of the Instrument semantic role from other semantic role categories.

<b><ins>4) Agreement attraction in Spanish-English codeswitching</ins></b>

<b>Keywords</b>: codeswitching, bilingualism, agreement attraction, sentence processing

Number agreement attraction, a process in which the number feature of a noun between a subject and a verb can cause mistakes with subject-verb number agreement, has been observed during online and offline processing in both English (Nicol et al. 1997; Haussler & Bader 2009; Wagers et al. 2009) and Spanish (Lago et al. 2015; Lago et al. 2021). However, current research has not addressed whether similar effects can be observed in sentences that codeswitch between the two languages. This study investigates whether attraction effects are found in sentences that switch from English to Spanish. The results of two different online experiments (self-paced reading, L-maze) do not display the expected agreement attraction effects, but an offline task (acceptability judgment) does show agreement attraction effects. These results suggest that while the act of codeswitching can introduce ambiguity during sentence processing (cf. Valdés Kroff & Dussias 2023), agreement attraction effects are still recoverable from offline tasks, which refutes ideas of a "bilingual disadvantage" (cf. Bylund et al. 2023), and demonstrates the importance of utilizing a variety of tasks when investigating bilingual processing.

<b><ins>Mixing and Matching Gender: The Interaction of Gender Assignment Rules in Spanish-English Bilingual Speech</ins></b>

<b>Keywords</b>: codeswitching, bilingualism, grammatical gender

This research project investigates how codeswitching (CS) functions for Spanish-English bilingual speakers in utterances that feature noun phrase (NP) ellipsis and <em>one</em>-substitution, with particular focus on how the gender assignment rules of each language apply with regards to the elided and substituted material. Previous research has shown that when a switch occurs within an ellipsis site, the language of the elided material can be inferred from case markers on the remnants, and that further research on how gender markers function similarly is necessary (González-Vilbazo & Ramos, 2018). In addition to NP ellipsis, this paper investigates how gender markers can reveal information about the substituted material when a switch occurs within a <em>one</em>-substitution construction. 

This study employs an acceptability judgment survey which was designed to test bilingual speakers’ judgments of switched constructions involving NP ellipsis and <em>one</em>-substitution. The results suggest a syntactic analysis in which the remnant adjective plays an important role in assigning gender. In this analysis, the language of the elided referent is initially assumed to be the language of the antecedent. The remnant adjective signals whether the NP is marked for gender, which is represented with the privative feature [GEN]. A [GEN] marker requires that the elided NP, or referent, be marked [±FEM]; if it is not, a language switch is forced at the site, and the remnants will agree with the gender of the referent. Lack of a [GEN] marker means that the referent is not required to bear gender markers, and a language switch at the site is optional. If the elided referent is not marked [±FEM], the remnants will default to masculine markers. This analysis draws on previous investigations into CS and gender assignment, including research conducted by Merchant (2015), Valdés Kroff (2016), and Cruz (2021). The result is a set of proposed gender assignment rules which govern the syntactic structure at sites of codeswitched NP ellipsis and <em>one</em>-substitution.
