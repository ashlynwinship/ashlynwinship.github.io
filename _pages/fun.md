<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk">Skunk.</a> In particular, this description of a skunk from <i>The Jesuit Relations</i>:

"But it is so stinking and casts so foul an odor, that it is unworthy of being called the dog of Pluto. No sewer ever smelled so bad. I would not have believed it if I had not smelled it myself. Your heart almost fails you when you approach the animal; two have been killed in our court, and several days afterward there was such a dreadful odor throughout our house that we could not endure it. I believe the sin smelled by Saint Catherine de Sienne must have had the same vile odor."
